Dear community, today we are delighted to announce the release of Falco 0.35.0!

A big thank you to the whole community for helping get the latest release out.  
We are thrilled to share this release and its goodies with the community.  
To read a more detailed account of the release, see [v0.35.0 in the changelog](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0350).

## What‚Äôs new? üÜï
During this release cycle, we had 90+ PRs on Falco and a grand total of 170+ PRs for libs 0.11.0 and 60+ for drivers 5.0.0.  
Thank you to our maintainers and contributors, as this would not happen without your support, dedication, and contribution!

## Updates - TL;DR ü©≥
In release v0.35.0 the community focused on addressing the following key features: 
- Pushing the modern eBPF probe out of the experimental status
- Improving Falco performance, allowing to perfectly tailoring Falco to one's needs
- New Falco metrics
- Falco images signing
- Improving plugins SDK making the ground for the next big things :tm:
- test-infra revamp

## Modern eBPF probe üë®‚ÄçüöÄ
The new, modern eBPF probe was released as experimental during the 0.34.0 release cycle.  
We worked hard to implement all the remaining syscalls and behaviors to fill in what was missing, and now the same eBPF probe is out of the experimental status!  
Remember, it is a CO-RE probe; it means it does not need to download any external artifact as it is already built inside Falco!  
Moreover, it spots better performance compared to the old eBPF probe.  

Finally, while delivering the new eBPF probe, Andrea Terzolo also shipped a brand new drivers' testing framework, that is today used in libs CI to test each filler consistency between all 3 drivers!  
I think this alone was worth all the effort!  
On behalf of the whole community, thank you for your tremendous job!  

Remember, the new probe has stricter kernel releases requirements; for more info, check out our [blog post](https://falco.org/blog/falco-modern-bpf/)!

## Improved Falco performance
Thanks to the collaborative effort from Melissa Kilby, Jason Dellaluce, Andrea Terzolo and Federico Di Pierro, we were able to completely revamp the way that Falco detects syscalls that needs to be captured.  
Basically, with the new **adaptive syscalls** feature, Falco will only enable syscalls that are needed to detect the ruleset it is being ran with.  
It will also enable a bunch of syscalls that are needed for libsinsp internal state parsers, and that's it.  
Consequently, the `-A` flag meaning was updated. By default, ie: without the flag, heavy syscalls (like I/O ones) won't be captured, even if the ruleset ships with them, and a warning is shown to the user.  
Using the flag will instead allow Falco to capture even heavy syscalls, with no warning.

Moreover, a couple of config keys are now available to further tailor Falco adaptive syscalls feature to suit your use case.  
A related blog post will be published in the following days, stay tuned!  

Greatest thing you ask me? The huge libs refactor needed for this feature is the ground work for another highly requested feature: LSM and kprobes support!  

## Falco metrics
Thanks to yet another collaborative effort lead by Melissa, Falco does now expose a new, experimental `metrics` feature.  
It introduces a redesigned stats/metrics system, emitted as monotonic counters at predefined intervals (prometheus like).  
There are multiple options available: one can enable the output of these metrics as internal metric shapshot rule, allowing them to be notified as outputs.  
One can also choose to output metrics to a file, that is **not** rotated by Falco.  
Moreover, there are also options to enable CPU and memory usage metrics, internal kernel event counters and libbpf stats.  
All in all, this is a first, great step to improve Falco resources observability!  

## Falco images signing
Starting from 0.35.0, all Falco images that you can deploy in your cluster are now signed with [cosign 2.0](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) in keyless mode.  
This means that you can always verify that the Falco image you downloaded is an official Falco image coming from us, regardless of which registry you downloaded it from.  
Moreover, you don't have to install or explicitly trust any public key for it to work. This is the magic of cosign in action :magic_wand: !
So, how do you verify our brand new images? Install cosign 2 and run:
```
cosign verify docker.io/falcosecurity/falco:0.35.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/ --certificate-github-workflow-ref=refs/tags/0.35.0
```
And of course, you can do the same for all the deployable images including `falco`, `falco-driver-loader`, `falco-no-driver` and `falcoctl` (see its [repo](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl) for more details).  
This wouldn't have been possible without a big effort from Luca Guerra and Federico Di Pierro to migrate our entire release pipeline from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.  
The work is part of a larger effort from the Falco Supply Chain Working Group to bring all the Falco official artifacts up to date with the latest supply chain security standards.  
Special thanks to Massimiliano Giovagnoli, Batuhan Apaydƒ±n and Carlos Panato for your help and expertise in this area!

## Plugins workstream
Plugin API has seen quite a big effort, mainly from Jason, for further improvements.  
We have now got a protocol to allow plugins to access libsinsp state; moreover, they can now declare a state table that can be accessed by other plugins.  
Finally, they are also able to push a new async event to libsinsp main loop, to store data in state tables.  

## Test-infra revamp
Let me once again start from the thanksgiving: Massimiliamo Giovagnoli and Samuele Cappellin did a tremendous job to improve our infra.  
Prow is now lighter, quicker and less issue-prone. Multiple prow jobs were moved to github action to improve cluster efficiency; moreover, drivers building jobs are now much less frequently killed (basically never).  
Also, arm64 drivers are now built on arm64 nodes, without using qemu, speeding up the build time.  
At the same time, resources allocated to the cluster were enlarged, with autoscaling limits now set to 20 arm nodes and 20 x86 nodes.  
Indeed, we can now deliver weekly new driver's artifacts much quicker than before!  
Finally, the cluster does now expose grafana dashboards for monitoring purposes: https://monitoring.prow.falco.org/.  

## What's Next? üîÆ

It‚Äôs time to try out the new release! Here are some pointers for getting started with Falco:

* [Container Images](/docs/getting-started/running/#docker)
  * `falco` ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/falcosecurity/falco), [AWS ECR Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco))
  * `falco-no-driver` ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/falcosecurity/falco-no-driver), [AWS ECR Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-no-driver))
  * `falco-driver-loader` ([DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader), [AWS ECR Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader))
* [CentOS/Amazon Linux](/docs/getting-started/installation/#centos-rhel)
* [Debian/Ubuntu](/docs/getting-started/installation/#debian)
* [openSUSE](/docs/getting-started/installation/#suse)

The community is active on many topics and we are thrilled for the next workstreams!  
We hope to deliver great features and many stability fixes once again during the next release cycle :rocket:

We will revisit and improve libsinsp API, for a more coherent developer experience.

Finally, LSM and kprobes are going to get implemented, and that means...security goodies!

As I shared, plugin API has seen huge improvements; we expect new plugins using the new features very soon!

Fixes, fixes and also fixes everywhere; above all, we will surely work to improve thread tables and process trees inconsistencies; that's a huge topic and we plan to tackle it in multiple ways!  

## Stay Tuned ü§ó
